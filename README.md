# Real-Time-Sentiment-Driven-Market-Simulation
An end-to-end pipeline integrating financial news sentiment (NLP) with stochastic stock price models (Geometric Brownian Motion, Monte Carlo simulations) to forecast short-term price dynamics. 

Trained ML models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to classify price movement direction, achieving 75% directional accuracy (AUC = 0.80). Deployed an automated system combining APIs (Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI), SQL storage, and a Streamlit dashboard for real-time updates.
